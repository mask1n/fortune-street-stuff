## Requirements
- This script assumes you've already patched an NTSC Fortune Street ISO with [Custom Street World Tour](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/CustomStreetWorldTour)
- Python 3.6 or later
- [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/)
- [py-dolphin-memory-engine](https://github.com/henriquegemignani/py-dolphin-memory-engine) (use `pip install dolphin-memory-engine` to install)

## How to use
1. Start emulation of CSWT in Dolphin
2. Run `injectname.py`
3. After selecting your characters and advancing to the board selection screen, you'll be prompted to input each player's name
4. Enjoy! ðŸ˜ƒ

## TODO
