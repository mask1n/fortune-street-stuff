## Requirements
- An ISO/WBFS file of either **„ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åç„Çπ„Éà„É™„Éº„ÉàWii** (ST7JGD), **Fortune Street** (ST7E01), **Boom Street** (ST7P01) or **Custom Street World Tour** (ST7E02, ST7P02)
- Python 3.6 or later
- [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/)
- [py-dolphin-memory-engine](https://github.com/henriquegemignani/py-dolphin-memory-engine) (optional if using the Windows release binary) (use `pip install dolphin-memory-engine` to install)
- An x86_64-based version of Windows or Linux (currently DME lacks Mac support)

## How to use
1. Start emulation in Dolphin
2. Run `namereplace.py` (or [namereplace.exe](https://github.com/mask1n/fortune-street-stuff/releases/latest) for Windows users if you're using the release version)
3. After selecting your characters and advancing to the board selection screen, you'll be prompted to input each player's name
4. Enjoy! üòÉ

## Limitations
- Currently the script has no way to distinguish between Custom Street World Tour and ISOs generated by [CSMM](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/csmm-qt) that have a Game ID ending in 02, resulting in the wrong memory addresses being used - for the time being I'd recommend changing the value to 01 before generating the ISO file.
